# Apriori Algorithm Implementation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Apriori Algorithm implementation! This Jupyter Notebook allows you to explore association rule mining using your own datasets. The Apriori algorithm is a popular data mining technique used to uncover interesting relationships between items in large datasets, commonly known as market basket analysis. 

## What is the Apriori Algorithm?

The Apriori algorithm identifies frequent itemsets in transactional data and derives association rules from these itemsets. An association rule is an implication of the form \(A ⇒ B\), which means that if an item (or set of items) \(A\) is purchased, then item \(B\) is likely to be purchased as well.

### Key Terms:

- **Support**: The support of an itemset is the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain the itemset. It helps in determining the frequency of occurrence.
  
- **Confidence**: The confidence of an association rule \(A ⇒ B\) is the proportion of the transactions containing \(A\) that also contain \(B\). It measures the reliability of the inference made by the rule.

## Why Use the Apriori Algorithm?

Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses looking to enhance sales and improve marketing strategies. Here’s how the Apriori algorithm can be beneficial:

- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identify which products are frequently bought together. This information can help in product placement and cross-selling strategies.
  
- **Recommendation Systems**: Enhance customer experience by recommending products based on previous purchases.
  
- **Inventory Management**: Optimize stock levels by understanding product relationships and customer buying patterns.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `mlxtend`
  - `numpy`


## Understanding Support and Confidence

Support and confidence are important metrics used to find patterns in data.

- **Support** indicates how often an item appears in the dataset. For example, if Bread appears in 40 out of 100 transactions, its support is 40%.

- **Confidence** shows how likely it is that one item appears when another item is present. For example, if 30 transactions include both Bread and Butter, and 40 include Bread, then 75% of the time, when someone buys Bread, they also buy Butter.
## Inputting Thresholds

When using the application, you will enter support and confidence thresholds:

- **Support Threshold**: Filters out itemsets that are not common (e.g., only consider itemsets appearing in at least 20% of transactions).

- **Confidence Threshold**: Filters out weak rules (e.g., only consider rules where the second item appears at least 70% of the time when the first item is present).

Adjusting these thresholds helps you find the most relevant patterns in your data.


### How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: 
   - Your dataset should be in CSV format, structured in a single column. Each row should represent a transaction with items separated by commas.
   - Example format:
     ```
     shrimp,almonds,avocado,vegetables mix,green grapes,whole wheat flour,yams,cottage cheese,energy drink,tomato juice,low fat yogurt,green tea,honey,salad,mineral water,salmon,antioxidant juice,frozen smoothie,spinach,olive oil
     burgers,meatballs,eggs
     chutney
     ```

2. **Load the Jupyter Notebook**: 
   - Open `apriori.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Run the Preprocessing Step**: 
   - The notebook will preprocess the data to convert it into a suitable format for the Apriori algorithm.

4. **Input Support and Confidence**: 
   - You will be prompted to input the desired support and confidence values. These parameters will guide the algorithm in generating association rules.

5. **View Results**: 
   - The resulting DataFrame will display the association rules derived from your data, along with their support and confidence values.

## Example Output

The output will include a DataFrame containing the following columns:
- **Antecedents**: The item(s) in the rule.
- **Consequents**: The item(s) that are likely to be purchased when the antecedents are bought.
- **Support**: The support of the rule.
- **Confidence**: The confidence of the rule.
- **Lift**: A measure of how much more likely the antecedent is to occur with the consequent than without it.
